# Awesome Inc WebDev Bootcamp Blog

### By Alex Galvan:

1.  Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?

    -   Before the bootcamp, I had no expectations, all I know is that there has been a lot of reading! I am learning things that I find super facinating that I never knew excisted. Github has been front and center this week alongside with gitpod. So cool that the google chrome browser has a plug in that allows you to click a button and the repo is opened in an editor ready for you to mess around with some code. 

2.  What are you excited or eager to learn more about?

    -   I am excited to learn how to build a full stack application. Excited to be able to  have a front end talk to the backend. I have attempted to build an app myself and got pretty far; I do not think it was up to industry standards. I am eager to be able to have some training from professionals in the industry to polish and add to my current skillset.

3.  What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?
    -   I am terrefied of talking infront of people. Hopefully after the bootcamp, I can overcome this discomfort.
