# Awesome Inc WebDev Bootcamp Blog

### By Alex Galvan:

1.  Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?

    -   Before the bootcamp, I had no expectations, all I know is that there has been a lot of reading! I am learning I find super fascinating that I never knew excisted. Github has been front and center this week alongside with gitpod. So cool that the google chrome browser has a plug in that allows you to click a button and the repo is opened in an editor ready for you to mess around with the code. 

2.  What are you excited or eager to learn more about?

    -   I am excited to learn how to build a full stack application. Excited to be able to  have a front end talk to the backend. I have attempted to build an app myself and got pretty far; I do not think it was up to industry standards though. I am eager to receive some training from professionals in the industry to polish and add to my current skillset.


    here is something that I got to do in grasshopper: 
    -   ```
        function sum(a, b){
            return a + b;
        }

        sum(1,2)
        >> 3
        ```    


3.  What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?
  
    -   I am terrefied of talking infront of people. Hopefully after the bootcamp, I can overcome this discomfort. 
    I also have a crazy puppy!
