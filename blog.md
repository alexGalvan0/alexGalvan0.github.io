# Awesome Inc WebDev Bootcamp Blog

## By Alex Galvan

1.  Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
    -   Before the bootcamp, I had no expectations, all I know is that there has been a lot of reading! I am learning things that I find super facinating that I never knew excisted. Github has been front and center this week alongside with gitpod. So cool that the google chrome browser has a plug in that allows you to click a button and the repo is opened in an editor ready for you to mess around with some code.
