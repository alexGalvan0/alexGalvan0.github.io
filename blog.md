# Awesome Inc WebDev Bootcamp Blog

### By Alex Galvan:

1.  #### Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?

    >   Before the bootcamp, I really did not have any expectations, however I was not expecting the amount of reading we did this first week. I also did not expect to lear as much about git as I did! The way that git works is so freaking cool. To know how the industry releseas beta applications or features then deploys them to be the stable build is pretty great. 

2. #### What are you excited or eager to learn more about?

    >   I am excited to learn how to build a full stack application using Javascript and python. Excited to be able to  have a front end talk to the backend. I have attempted to build an app myself and got pretty far; I do not think it was up to industry standards though. I am eager to receive some training from professionals in the industry to polish and add to my current skillset. I am also really wanting to learn C# after the bootcamp.


3. #### What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?
  
    >   I am not sure what happened to me but during the last year or so, I developed an strong interest in grilling. A perfect evening for me is getting home from work, get the burgers ready, crack open a cold beverage, and grill.


#### These are some of the CLI commands that I learned this week

```
// git touch <NAME OF FILE> 

// git branch 

// git branch <BRANCH NAME> 

//git commit -m 'message'

//git push origin main
```
