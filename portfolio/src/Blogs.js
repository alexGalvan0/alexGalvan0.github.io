      "Before the bootcamp, I really did not have any expectations,however I was not expecting the amount of\
      reading we did this firstweek. I also did not expect to lear as much about git as I did! Theway that git\
      works is so freaking cool. To know how the industryreleseas beta applications or features then deploys them\
      to be the stable build is pretty great. I am excited to learn how to build a full stack application using \
      Javascript and python. Excited to be able to  have a front end talk to the backend. I have attempted to build an \
      app myself and got pretty far; I do not think it was up to industry standards though. I am eager to receive some\
      training from professionals in the industry to polish and add to my current skillset. I am also really wanting\
      to learn C# after the bootcamp.I am not sure what happened to me but during the last year or so, I developed\
      an strong interest in grilling. A perfect evening for me is getting home from work, get the burgers ready,\
      crack open a cold beverage, and grill. ",

      "I wisht that I had more experience with the animations, transitions, and transform properties in css.\
      I am not a fan of a overly designed page with so many animations and transitions. I view simplicity more\
      beautiful than complication. The animations and transitions are sometimes a nice flavorful feature if done\
      right. I am struggeling in following the directions for the final project. I read the instructions but\
      saw this is what the page 'might' look like when youre done. I saw the instructions as a visual guidince,\
      not a make this exact page below. google.com. There are some problems that are very unique to your situation\
      that you might not be able to just google it, however more than likley someone has already built it and done\
      it. One thing that I sometimes struggle is re-inventing the wheel. I will got fixaded on trying to understand\
      how to do something that has been done before and before I know it, it has been hours of time. I like to go\
      on walks and take my mind a break. Sometimes i just need to go to sleep and will have the answer by morning.\
      (typically in the shower for some reason)",

    answer: "HTML semantics are so fascinating to me. The HTML tag goes beyond just displaying to a page. They are also used by search engines and\
            other web tools to be able to give the user a better experience. You could take the default styling off from the browser, and no matter \
            what tag you use, it would all look the same. CSS is an absolute beast. You always think about languages that are difficult to pick up. CSS\
            should be up there. With all of the different properties, there are some really cool things you can do. Technically, CSS is a style language\
            but I see functionality support increasing over the past few years. Besides Just changing color and size of HTML elements, you are now able\
            to calculate, create variables and more to be able to make apps more dynamic. This is needed because of how many different platforms we have now.\
            including: web, ios, android, mac, windows and more I am sure. All of these platforms have their own different screen sizes and shapes. CSS has adapted\
            to be able to help the developer create dynamic elements that can detect the platform it is on and adapt. I am trying to figure out how much time I want \
            to spend on CSS vs Javascripts and other technologies. I mainly care more about App functionality and ease of use, however in my experience working with\
            graphic designers and just as a consumer in general, It is  very important to make sure something not only looks good, but it's intuitive across all sorts\
            of platforms. CSS, easy to learn, hard to get good at.  Javascript has been my favorite out of the technologies we have learned so far. I see it\
            as a playground to be able to create solutions to an opportuniy. With JS, the sky is the limmit. Some people will express creativity in CSS and HTML;\
            My creativity will be in Javascript. Thinking of logic to solve problems is my happy place. CSS and HTML are the things that people see where as JS\
            is the 'Magic' that brings it together. It allows applications to interact with the world with APIs. I am so very thankful to have an oportunity to\
            learn from trained professionals in this field. I am very thankful to be able to have the opportunity to do this bootcamp. I have been trying to\
            teach myself all of these things on my own for the past 3 or so years. There has always been this internal battle that I am comfortable in this\
            amazing job, with an amazing team and all of these great benefits, howerver there was always an itch to grow in development. I have been keeping\
            it a secret because I knew that my current employer was in no need of a developer and didn't want to show my cards just yet for the fear of \
            getting let go. (weird i know). I have this sense of peace being in this corse, learning what I want to be learning. Pseudocode is like eating\
            healthy. You don't want to, but it's good for you. The more you do it, the easier it gets. As process oriented as I am, when does the scope of\
            you project end? In some of the examples from the Hopper group, I saw that some people had logic that IF they didn't have a material needed to\
            continue in their process, go to the store. Well, what the process of going to the store, and buying something? I know this is an overkill to\
            think about all of this when you are designing an app, or is it? I enjoy that pseudocode makes you think about all these things, however \
            I need to scope the project and stick to it. Be comfortable at ending the program without the outcome you are trying to accomplish.",

    answer:"The daily standup meetings were super helpful. \
            Reading the documentation was actually super helpfull as \
            well. I know it is not the most fun to do, but there is some \
            gold in there. I would find some key words thatI could then later \
            look up on youtube and get a more visual representation. When it \
            came to git, I never thought I would be using the cli for it. Now \
            I am crystal on the concepts that we use. Super helpful for when a \
            job comes around, I can be confident. Having a 5 month puppy has also \
            been a challenge becuase of all of the attention it requires. Overall a \
            plesant experince. I really do not use social media, or are on my phone a \
            lot. I struggle having checking the slack. During onboarding, I was still \
            working around 20ish hours a week which I am glad I had the opportunity to \
            do so however, I had some tough days where I had too much on work and \
            bootcamp tasks to do. There were days that the only way to complete everything \
            is waking up around 5am which was tough because I crashed pretty hard the last \
            demo day of onboarding.My wife set up an office space for me in an un used room.\
            I have a very comortable setup that allowed me to focus on learning. Becuase \
            I knew what we were going to be learning during the bootcamp, I have been trying \
            to teach myself the content for the past few months. This really helped me keep \
            my head above water I believe. Seeing some progress has also fuled me as well. I \
            Love getting AHA! moments. I had forgotten how they felt, and they feel good. I \
            love adding things to my toolbox for later use."

    answer:"Not asking questions really hurt me. I need to remember that I there to learn, \
            not to show people what I already know. Let my pride go and be comfortable being \
            uncomfortable. I just thought the entire time we were making the mind reader,that \
            there was a better easier way to do this. I would like to be able to code with more \
            optimal solutions, and write better formatted code. I enjoy making people's life easier \
            through applications and development. I also enjoy building things from scratch. This is \
            something that I have been wanting to dive into the past 3 years or so. This is my \
            chance to become a developer. "

  answer:"Pseudocoding has been a huge help. I really have to get better at logically solving \
          the problem before attempting. I struggle with figuring it out in my head and not waning to \
          write it down. I have got to get better at pseudocoding. I also learned that it is very \
          important to breakdown the problems into smaller problems. I really would like to expand \
          more on named variables as well. I think that made my life so much easier. I could also \
          see myself using them more in my projects. Makes code easy to read and easier to manage \
          function parameters. What does it mean to be a good developer? Being able to meet the needs \
          required in an appropriate amount of time. Also communication. Communicate what is going on in \
          the project. Being a  good developer I would say is also just being a good person. Share \
          victories with teamates and share burdens as well. Sharing solutions and lears is also a \
          great way to be a good developer. I enjoy katas when I can figure them out. I would also say \
          from experience, being rushed is something that as a developer I dont really like that much. \
          I think it makes me a better developer though becuase I hit the goals that are needed and dont \
          spend too much time on other things. I also think it minimizes scope creep. "
