      "Before the bootcamp, I really did not have any expectations,however I was not expecting the amount of\
      reading we did this firstweek. I also did not expect to lear as much about git as I did! Theway that git\
      works is so freaking cool. To know how the industryreleseas beta applications or features then deploys them\
      to be the stable build is pretty great. I am excited to learn how to build a full stack application using \
      Javascript and python. Excited to be able to  have a front end talk to the backend. I have attempted to build an \
      app myself and got pretty far; I do not think it was up to industry standards though. I am eager to receive some\
      training from professionals in the industry to polish and add to my current skillset. I am also really wanting\
      to learn C# after the bootcamp.I am not sure what happened to me but during the last year or so, I developed\
      an strong interest in grilling. A perfect evening for me is getting home from work, get the burgers ready,\
      crack open a cold beverage, and grill. ",

      "I wisht that I had more experience with the animations, transitions, and transform properties in css.\
      I am not a fan of a overly designed page with so many animations and transitions. I view simplicity more\
      beautiful than complication. The animations and transitions are sometimes a nice flavorful feature if done\
      right. I am struggeling in following the directions for the final project. I read the instructions but\
      saw this is what the page 'might' look like when youre done. I saw the instructions as a visual guidince,\
      not a make this exact page below. google.com. There are some problems that are very unique to your situation\
      that you might not be able to just google it, however more than likley someone has already built it and done\
      it. One thing that I sometimes struggle is re-inventing the wheel. I will got fixaded on trying to understand\
      how to do something that has been done before and before I know it, it has been hours of time. I like to go\
      on walks and take my mind a break. Sometimes i just need to go to sleep and will have the answer by morning.\
      (typically in the shower for some reason)",

      "HTML semantics are so fascinating to me. The HTML tag goes beyond just displaying to a page. They are also used by search engines and\
        other web tools to be able to give the user a better experience. You could take the default styling off from the browser, and no matter \
        what tag you use, it would all look the same. CSS is an absolute beast. You always think about languages that are difficult to pick up. CSS\
        should be up there. With all of the different properties, there are some really cool things you can do. Technically, CSS is a style language\
        but I see functionality support increasing over the past few years. Besides Just changing color and size of HTML elements, you are now able\
        to calculate, create variables and more to be able to make apps more dynamic. This is needed because of how many different platforms we have now.\
        including: web, ios, android, mac, windows and more I am sure. All of these platforms have their own different screen sizes and shapes. CSS has adapted\
        to be able to help the developer create dynamic elements that can detect the platform it is on and adapt. I am trying to figure out how much time I want \
        to spend on CSS vs Javascripts and other technologies. I mainly care more about App functionality and ease of use, however in my experience working with\
        graphic designers and just as a consumer in general, It is  very important to make sure something not only looks good, but it's intuitive across all sorts\
        of platforms. CSS, easy to learn, hard to get good at.  Javascript has been my favorite out of the technologies we have learned so far. I see it\
        as a playground to be able to create solutions to an opportuniy. With JS, the sky is the limmit. Some people will express creativity in CSS and HTML;\
        My creativity will be in Javascript. Thinking of logic to solve problems is my happy place. CSS and HTML are the things that people see where as JS\
        is the 'Magic' that brings it together. It allows applications to interact with the world with APIs. I am so very thankful to have an oportunity to\
        learn from trained professionals in this field. I am very thankful to be able to have the opportunity to do this bootcamp. I have been trying to\
        teach myself all of these things on my own for the past 3 or so years. There has always been this internal battle that I am comfortable in this\
        amazing job, with an amazing team and all of these great benefits, howerver there was always an itch to grow in development. I have been keeping\
        it a secret because I knew that my current employer was in no need of a developer and didn't want to show my cards just yet for the fear of \
        getting let go. (weird i know). I have this sense of peace being in this corse, learning what I want to be learning. Pseudocode is like eating\
        healthy. You don't want to, but it's good for you. The more you do it, the easier it gets. As process oriented as I am, when does the scope of\
        you project end? In some of the examples from the Hopper group, I saw that some people had logic that IF they didn't have a material needed to\
        continue in their process, go to the store. Well, what the process of going to the store, and buying something? I know this is an overkill to\
        think about all of this when you are designing an app, or is it? I enjoy that pseudocode makes you think about all these things, however \
        I need to scope the project and stick to it. Be comfortable at ending the program without the outcome you are trying to accomplish.",
