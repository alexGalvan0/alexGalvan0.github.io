1. What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?
> Not asking questions really hurt me. I need to remember that I there to learn, not to show people what I already know. Let my pride go and be comfortable being uncomfortable. 
2. What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?
> I just thought the entire time we were making the mind reader,that there was a better easier way to do this. I would like to be able to code with more optimal solutions, and write better formatted code. 
3. How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?
>  I really enjoy being in person. I like working with people and just grinding together. 
4. What is your “Why”?
> I enjoy making people's life easier through applications and development. I also enjoy building things from scratch. This is something that I have been wanting to dive into the past 3 years or so. This is my chance to become a developer.
