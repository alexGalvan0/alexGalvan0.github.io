1. Now that you are halfway through bootcamp, what has been the biggest hurdle that you have gone past? What do you think is going to be the next biggest thing to power through?
> Now that we are halfway, one of the struggles is explaining my code. I think before the bootcamp, I was not super confident in myself as a developer. It has been so cool to learn something well. 

2. Compared to earlier, what are three ideas you might want to do for your final project? Are they the same ideas as before, or have they changed now that you understand more about the technology and your limitations?

> Some ideas would be something social media related. I think that the project would really demonstrate the fullstack ability well. 
3. What surprised you about your first week in Python and how was it different from your first week in JavaScript?
