1. Now that you are halfway through bootcamp, what has been the biggest hurdle that you have gone past? What do you think is going to be the next biggest thing to power through?
> Now that we are halfway, one of the struggles is explaining my code. I think before the bootcamp, I was not super confident in myself as a developer. It has been so cool to learn something well and be confident about it. 

2. Compared to earlier, what are three ideas you might want to do for your final project? Are they the same ideas as before, or have they changed now that you understand more about the technology and your limitations?
> Some ideas would be something social media related. I think that the project would really demonstrate the fullstack ability well. That being said, I would like to shy away from creting a clone that has already been built. A profile based that where profiles can interact with other profiles. 

3. What surprised you about your first week in Python and how was it different from your first week in JavaScript? 
> I had actually dipped my toe into python before javascript. Python is not like riding a bike. If you stop using it, python gets a little fuzzy but have been trying to push myself this week to catch up to speed to where I was and continue to add to my knowledge base. The coolest thing about python is that there is some module for anything that you are doing. At one point in life I messed with libraries such as Selenium to create bots, Beautiful Soup to parse HTML pages, Pandas for data analysis and Matplot for visualizations. I am excited to create Databases with Django and just get more comfortable with the process.
