1. What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?
> I wisht that I had more experience with the animations, transitions, and transform properties in css.
I am not a fan of a overly designed page with so many animations and transitions. I view simplicity more beautiful than complication.
The animations and transitions are sometimes a nice flavorful feature if done right.  

2. What are you struggling with?
>  I am struggeling in following the directions for the final project. I read the instructions but saw this is what the page "might" look like when youre done. 
I saw the instructions as a visual guidince, not a make this exact page below.

3. How do you solve a problem?
> google.com. There are some problems that are very unique to your situation that you might not be able to just google it, however more than likley someone has already built it and done it. One thing that I sometimes struggle is re-inventing the wheel. I will got fixaded on trying to understand how to do something that has been done before and before I know it, it has been hours of time.

4. What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?
> I like to go on walks and take my mind a break. Sometimes i just need to go to sleep and will have the answer by morning. (typically in the shower for some reason)
