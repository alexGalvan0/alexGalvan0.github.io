1. What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?
> **HTML** semantics are so fascinating to me. The HTML tag goes beyond just displaying to a page. They are also used by search engines and other web tools to be able to give the user a better experience. You could take the default styling off from the browser, and no matter what tag you use, it would all look the same.

> **CSS** is an absolute beast. You always think about languages that are difficult to pick up. CSS should be up there. With all of the different properties, there are some really cool things you can do. Technically, CSS is a style language but I see functionality support increasing over the past few years. Besides Just changing color and size of HTML elements, you are now able to calculate, create variables and more to be able to make apps more dynamic. This is needed because of how many different platforms we have now. including: web, ios, android, mac, windows and more I am sure. All of these platforms have their own different screen sizes and shapes. CSS has adapted to be able to help the developer create dynamic elements that can detect the platform it is on and adapt. I am trying to figure out how much time I want to spend on CSS vs Javascripts and other technologies.

3. What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?
> Pseudocode is like eating healthy. You don't want to, but it's good for you. The more you do it, the easier it gets. As process oriented as I am, when does the scope of you project end? In some of the examples from the Hopper group, I saw that some people had logic that IF they didn't have a material needed to continue in their process, go to the store. Well, what the process of going to the store, and buying something? I know this is an overkill to think about all of this when you are designing an app, or is it? I enjoy that pseudocode makes you think about all these things, however I need to scope the project and stick to it. Be comfortable at ending the program without the outcome you are trying to accomplish.
