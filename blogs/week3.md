1. What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?
> **HTML** semantics are so fascinating to me. The HTML tag goes beyond just displaying to a page. They are also used by search engines and other web tools to be able to give the user a better experience. You could take the default styling off from the browser, and no matter what tag you use, it would all look the same.

> **CSS** is an absolute beast. You always think about languages that are difficult to pick up. CSS should be up there. With all of the different properties, there are some really cool things you can do. Technically, CSS is a style language but I see functionality support increasing over the past few years. Besides Just changing color and size of HTML elements, you are now able to calculate, create variables and more to be able to make apps more dynamic. This is needed because of how many different platforms we have now. including: web, ios, android, mac, windows and more I am sure. All of these platforms have their own different screen sizes and shapes. CSS has adapted to be able to help the developer create dynamic elements that can detect the platform it is on and adapt. I am trying to figure out how much time I want to spend on CSS vs Javascripts and other technologies. I mainly care more about App functionality and ease of use, however in my experience working with graphic designers and just as a consumer in general, It is  very important to make sure something not only looks good, but it's intuitive across all sorts of platforms. CSS, easy to learn, hard to get good at.  

> **Javascript** has been my favorite out of the technologies we have learned so far. I see it as a playground to be able to create solutions to an opportuniy. With JS, the sky is the limmit. Some people will express creativity in CSS and HTML; My creativity will be in Javascript. Thinking of logic to solve problems is my happy place. CSS and HTML are the things that people see where as JS is the 'Magic' that brings it together. It allows applications to interact with the world with APIs. I am so very thankful to have an oportunity to learn from trained professionals in this field. 

2. What are some objects that your blog incorporates?
> I am very thankful to be able to have the opportunity to do this bootcamp. I have been trying to teach myself all of these things on my own for the past 3 or so years. There has always been this internal battle that I am comfortable in this amazing job, with an amazing team and all of these great benefits, howerver there was always an itch to grow in development. I have been keeping it a secret because I knew that my current employer was in no need of a developer and didn't want to show my cards just yet for the fear of getting let go. (weird i know). I have this sense of peace being in this corse, learning what I want to be learning. 

3. What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?
> Pseudocode is like eating healthy. You don't want to, but it's good for you. The more you do it, the easier it gets. As process oriented as I am, when does the scope of you project end? In some of the examples from the Hopper group, I saw that some people had logic that IF they didn't have a material needed to continue in their process, go to the store. Well, what the process of going to the store, and buying something? I know this is an overkill to think about all of this when you are designing an app, or is it? I enjoy that pseudocode makes you think about all these things, however I need to scope the project and stick to it. Be comfortable at ending the program without the outcome you are trying to accomplish.
