1. What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?
> - The daily standup meetings were super helpful. Reading the documentation was actually super helpfull as well. I know it is not the most fun to do, but there is some gold in there. I would find some key words thatI could then later look up on youtube and get a more visual representation. When it came to git, I never thought I would be using the cli for it. Now I am crystal on the concepts that we use. Super helpful for when a job come around, I can be confident. Having a 5 month puppy has also been a challenge becuase of all of the attention it requires. Overall a plesant experince. 


2. What hindered your progress during Onboarding?
> - I really do not use social media, or are on my phone a lot. I struggle having checking the slack. During onboarding, I was still working around 20ish hours a week which I am glad I had the opportunity to do so however, I had some tough days where I had too much on work and bootcamp tasks to do. There were days that the only way to complete evreythong is waking up around 5am which was tough because I crashed pretty hard the last demo day of onboarding. 


3. How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?
> - My wife set up an office space for me in an un used room. I have a very comortable setup that allowed me to focus on learning. Becuase I knew what we were going to be learning during the bootcamp, I have been trying to teach myself the content for the past few months. This really helped me keep my head above water I believe.
