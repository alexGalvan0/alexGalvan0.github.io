1. What did you learn about that helped you understand the development process?
> Pseudocoding has been a huge help. I really have to get better at logically solving the problem before attempting.
I struggle with figuring it out in my head and not waning to write it down. I have got to get better at pseudocoding. I also learned that it is very important to breakdown the problems into smaller problems. I really would like to expand more on named variables as well. I think that made my life so much easier. I could also see myself using them more in my projects. Makes code easy to read and easier to manage function parameters. 

2. What does it mean to develop good code?
> 1. No errors, if errors, handle them.
> 2. Self Socumenting. So others can work on it as well.
> 3. Code that meets the needs that it is expected to meet.

3. What does it mean to be a good developer?
> Being able to meet the needs required in an appropriate amount of time. Also communication. Communicate what is going on in the project. Being a  good developer I would say is also just being a good person. Share victories with teamates and share burdens as well. Sharing solutions and lears is also a great way to be a good developer. 

4. What is one thing that programmers hate doing?
> Katas. just kidding. I enjoy katas when I can figure them out. I would also say from experience, being rushed is something that as a developer I dont really like that much. I think it makes me a better developer though becuase I hit the goals that are needed and dont spend too much time on other things. I also think it minimizes scope creep.
